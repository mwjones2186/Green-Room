  ## Description 

  Hobbista is an interactive hobby connection app. It allows a user to select a hobby from a list then render nearby stores to get supplies for thier hobby, local areas of interest pertaining to said hobby and allow access to our message board. The message board is silod into the general category of hobby and is populated with other users posts, comments, suggestions and anything else related to the category hobby. Once a user created an account, they will be able to create, post and save posts they are interested in or want to follow for further information. The application is starting small but we have big plans to capture more information and exciting new hobbies.

  Hobbista was created for the fact that there are so many possibilities for hobbies and especially in this post covid era, many people are locked at home or working from home or simply not as out and about as they used to be. We really want our message board to be more than a simple post and comment. We want it to be a bit more interactive. Posts on new local groups for new people to the area with similar interests. We want it to be more engaging with individuals with like minded connections. We want people to take on the challenge of a new hobby and want to provide the user all motivation and encouragement in order to do it. We will continue to add new functionality in order to capture more of the endless possibilities. We would love to be the one stop shop for the individual who loves to ride unicycles and talk about pugs. We want to encapsulate that unique obscure activity and connect the people who enjoy that as much as the next person. 

  There are obviously places where all of this is possible such as facebook or other social media giants. We want to be the niche and focus on one large category vs simply providing the billion users something else to do. As much as we are screen based in this day and age,  also creates a large demand for getting off the screen. We want to challenge users to utilize the platform  to find thier next thing that truly intrests or inspires them and give them the tools to go do it. A functional way to start small and grow as the hobby or interest grows. We do not want to stop at the simple local shop that has some of that stuff but provide information on upcoming events, conventions, meet ups or specialty locations. 

  I learned that it takes a lot of code to get the data you want. Its a new found respect for these tech giants like google where i can type 'hiking' and instantly learn find anything I could ever imagine on the subject. Its an absurd amount of api searching, seeking and displaying.  Also learned a ton about the connection between frontend, middleware and backend and how they all work harmoniously in order to provide a positive user interface. I also learned how a seed of an idea can spark a grandois idea and have to refocus on the important MVP model in order to render something respectable, on point and displaying the core of our overall goal. How to have an idea and have to cut it in order for the project to move forward.

 

  ## Installation
  1. Clone the Repo 2. Open terminal and run 'npm init -y' 3. In terminal run 'npm i' 4. Download and open heroku. 5. Go back to terminal and run 'npm start' this will initialize heroku and the app will run.

  ## Usage

  Once heroku or localhost is going, its pretty intuitive. login if you have an account or sign up for an account. You will then be taken to the initial user page where a user can select from a list of hobbies. They will also have an option to insert thier own hobby of choice. Though in version 1.0 we will not have the database and hobby options, we plan to continuously add more into our database. Based on the user selections, the next page will render thier selections followed by stores to get thier new or existing hobby supplies, local points of interest pertaining to thier hobby, and access to our message board. Once a user clicks on the 'go to message board' button, they will be taken to a page that displayes the main thread pages of thier hobby selection. Then the user can decide which hobby they want to explore next. Once a category is selected, they will end up in the main thread message board where all topics that fall under the main category umbrella land. I.e. if you select outdoors, you will end up in the outdoor thread page that will have post for hiking, fishing, backpaking, camping etc. The user will also have a search bar that will allow them to search through the threads to find specifically what they are looking for. If found, they can read, comment, post or save the post. Otherwise they are more than welcome to start a new post and allow other users to comment and reply. 

  ## Contribution

  It would be fantastic if users would post ideas for building out this product. What features would be important in an app like this. What other APIs can we get relevant info from? Feedback on the functionality and what would be important to store to a user account page. Also for a shout out if this app is used. Blast us on the social media when you find that new hobby and group that has become your new interest family! 

  ## Tests

  Lots of small blocks of code to make sure it functions the way it should. no formal tests such as jest, mocha or jasmine. All testing was done with a whole lot of console logging and trial and error. lots and lots of errors.
